      <h2>ECU Remapping</h2>
      <p>
        Software modifications that remap an automobile's electronic control unit (ECU) improve the engine.  
        Manufacturers limit the ECU's ability to manipulate fuel, air, and power for safety and commercial reasons. 
        Benefits include increased horsepower, smoother acceleration, and improved fuel efficiency depending on the tuning type selected.

      <h2>Suspension Upgrades</h2>
      <p>
        Upgrading or improving components makes suspension more responsive, stable, and comfortable.  
        Examples: performance bushings, coilovers, improved shock absorbers, and stronger springs.  
        Benefits: better handling, reduced body sway, and sharper steering accuracy.

      <h2>Exhaust Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Performance exhausts let gases exit more efficiently, boosting power and throttle response.  
        They also give a sportier sound and are built from durable materials like stainless steel.
